# USD-Graduate-Program
Cataloging my progress through USD Applied Artificial Intelligence Master's Program

As of this pages creation, I have completed the first two semesters at USD. I will upload projects completed as a repository of work completed. I hope to revisit these to improve the viability of the models created. After thinking about this, I may just create updated pages for new files in order to demonstrate the growth process along the way.

As a mechanical engineer by trade, many times I look to the interwebs to see what solutions are out there. As such, many of these initial projects may not be the best formated as I only have 1 week to complete them. Many times I will jump between NumPy, Keras, Tensorflow, or all of the above. Many times this is because, finding an example is the most efficient means to getting a working model- even if it is not the prettiest of things.
